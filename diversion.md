4. Where are you now, exactly?
5. Pick destination within available time & weather restrictions
6. Pick set point
7. Draw line from set point to destination
8. Establish Magnetic HDG & distance
9. Establish GS (100 kts)
10. Calculate ETE / ETA
11. Choose mid point to calculate GS, ETE / ETA, & correct heading

### Fly

12. At set point, set DG, note time, fly the diversion picking a landmark on the horizon
13. Update flight plan with FSS/FIC, new destination and new ETA

### Update

14. At the mid point, note time and recalculate GS and ETE / ETA, update FIC if required
15. Correct the course as required to maintain the anticipated line. (Advise examiner of corrections)
