# Flight Test

## 23.D Diversion

Objective: Safely carry out a diversion to an alternate destination using mental in-flight planning, dead reckoning, map reading and pilotage.

(verify)

1. Reduce speed to 70 kts with 20 degrees flap.
2. Verify fuel level (remaining time is the most important)
3. Establish your existing location on the map
4. Pick a destination within your available time
5. Draw a line to your destination
6. Establish heading and distance
7. Establish ground speed
8. Calculate ETE / ETA
9. Proceed on diversino
10. Make appropriate calls to update flight plan with FSS/FIC

## 16.B 1 Short Field Takeoff

## 16.B 2 Soft Field Takeoff

## 18 Landing Briefing?

## 18.B 1 Short Field Approach and Landing

## 18.B 2 Soft Field Approach and Landing

## 18.C Overshoot

## 21 Precautionary Landing

## 22 Forced Landing

Objective: Demonstrate an approach that safely touches down in the first third of a suitable landing area upon simulated engine failure. *Clear the engine every 500 feet*

1. Trim for best glide (65 kts) and apply carb heat. (maintain +10/-5 kts tolerance)
2. Confirm fuel: both, mixture: full rich, Throttle: open, mags: both
3. Assess wind speed and direction to determine safe landing direction
4. Locate a touch-down point and establish where to be on final approach. Declare the field to the examiner.
5. If you have enough time, try to start the engine.
6. Turn on the ELT, Squawk 7700, MAYDAY 121.5 MHz call sign, position, engine failure
7. Fuel: off, mixture: Idle cutoff, mags off, alternator off
8. Passenger briefing: what's happening, wear seatbelts, exit to the rear, protect your head with something soft
9. Crack doors
10. On final full flaps once you're sure you'll make the spot
11. Master Off
12. Land in field
13. Exit to the rear

## 29 Emergency Procedures / Malfunctions

---

### a. partial power loss (POH 3-16 GNLR) (see also rough engine operation)

* CARBURETOR ICING

  See item i below.

* SPARK PLUG FOULING

1. test each mag to confirm one is much worse, return to BOTH
2. lean mixture and wait several minutes
3. if this doesn't work try enrichening to smooth out
4. if problem still exists land at the nearest airport on BOTH mags unless roughness necessitates only one

* MAGNETO MALFUNCTION

1. test each mag to confirm one is much worse
2. modify power setting and enrichen mixture to determine whether continued operation on BOTH is possible
3. If not, switch to good mag and land at nearest airport

### b. rough engine operation or overheat

* LOW OIL PRESSURE

1. *Oil temperature is rising*: engine failure may be imminent. Reduce power immediately and select forced landing field. Use minimum power to reach touchdown spot.
2. *Oil temperature is normal*: this could be a gauge malfunction. Land at nearest airport

### c. loss of oil pressure

  1. Precautionary Landing

### d. fuel starvation

### e. electrical fire

  1. Master OFF
  2. Avionics Switch OFF
  3. All switches except ignition OFF
  4. Vents/Cabin Air/Heat CLOSED
  5. Fire Extinguisher ACTIVATE. After discharge of extinguisher, vent the cabin
  6. Master ON
  7. Circuit Breakers CHECK for faulty, do not reset
  8.  

### f. vacuum system failure

### g. pitot or static blockage

  [Video Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BMCyBD80Fk&t=85s)

  1. Alternate Static Source Valve FULL ON
  2. Pitot Heat ON
  3. Airspeed â€” Consult appropriate calibration tables in Section 5 of POH

### h. cabin fire

  1. Master OFF
  2. Vents/Cabin Air/Heat CLOSED (to avoid drafts)
  3. Fire Extinguisher ACTIVATE. After discharging an extinguisher within a closed cabin, ventilate the cabin.
  4. Land ASAP

### i. carb icing

  [Video Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4lwLffGEkA&t=113s)

  1. Carb Heat ON FULL (POH 3-16)
  2. Power FULL
  3. Leave until engine operation is smooth
  4. If conditions require continued use in cruise, use the minimum necessary to prevent ice and lean for smoothest operation

### j. electrical malfunctions

  OVER-VOLTAGE LIGHT ILLUMINATES

  1. Avionics Power OFF
  2. Master OFF (both sides)
  3. Master ON
  4. Over-voltage Light CHECK OFF
  5. Avionics Power ON
  6. If over-voltage light illuminates again, terminate flight as soon as possible

  AMMETER SHOWS DISCHARGE

  1. Alternator OFF (Master)
  2. Nonessential Radio/Electrical Equipment OFF
  3. Terminate flight as soon as possible

### k. landing gear malfunctions

  LANDING WITH A FLAT MAIN TIRE

  1. Approach NORMAL
  2. Touchdown GOOD TIRE FIRST, hold airplan off flat tire as long as possible.

### l. brake failure or seizure

### m. flap failure

### n. door opening in flight

### o. spin recovery

  PARE

  1. Power IDLE
  2. Ailerons NEUTRAL
  3. Rudder (FULL OPPOSITE SPIN)
  4. Elevator FORWARD to break the stall
  5. Hold the inputs until the spin stops, then neutralize rudder and recover from dive.

### p. emergency descent

  [Cabin Fire emergency descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc8RjuKCn_U&t=119s)

  1. Power IDLE
  2. 45 degree bank turn and let speed climb to V<sub>NO</sub> (128 KIAS on GNLR)

  [WITH FLAPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc8RjuKCn_U&t=267s)

  1. Power IDLE
  2. 45 degree bank turn and let speed stay at V<sub>FE</sub> (85 KIAS on GNLR)
  3. When at V<sub>FE</sub> full flaps

### q. any other emergency unique to the type of aeroplane flown
