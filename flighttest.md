## 21 Precautionary Landing

## 22 Forced Landing

Objective: Demonstrate an approach that safely touches down in the first third of a suitable landing area upon simulated engine failure. *Clear the engine every 500 feet*

### Cause Check

1. Trim for best glide (65 kts) and apply carb heat. (maintain +10/-5 kts tolerance)
2. Confirm fuel: both, mixture: full rich, Throttle: open, mags: both, Master ON, Primer in and locked

### Vent-Champs-Plan

3. Assess wind speed and direction to determine safe landing direction
4. Locate a touch-down point and establish where to be on final approach. Declare the field to the examiner.

### Restart / Secure Engine

5. If you have enough time, try to start the engine.
6. Fuel: off, mixture: Idle cutoff, mags off, alternator off

### Communicate
7. Turn on the ELT
8. Squawk 7700
9. MAYDAY 121.5 MHz call sign, position, engine failure
10. Passenger briefing: what's happening, wear seatbelts, exit to the rear, protect your head with something soft, first aid kit

### Final Approach
11. Crack doors
12. On final full flaps once you're sure you'll make the spot
13. Master Off
14. Land in field
15. Exit to the rear

## 23.D Diversion

Objective: Safely carry out a diversion to an alternate destination using mental in-flight planning, dead reckoning, map reading and pilotage.

(verify)

1. Reduce speed to 70 kts with 20 degrees flap.
2. Verify fuel level (remaining time is the most important)
3. Establish your existing location on the map
4. Pick a destination within your available time
5. Draw a line to your destination
6. Establish heading and distance
7. Establish ground speed
8. Calculate ETE / ETA
9. Proceed on diversino
10. Make appropriate calls to update flight plan with FSS/FIC

## 29 Emergency Procedures / Malfunctions

---

### a. partial power loss (POH 3-16 GNLR) (see also rough engine operation)

* CARBURETOR ICING - See item i below.

* SPARK PLUG FOULING

1. test each mag to confirm one is much worse, return to BOTH
2. lean mixture and wait several minutes
3. if this doesn't work try enrichening to smooth out
4. if problem still exists land at the nearest airport on BOTH mags unless roughness necessitates only one

* MAGNETO MALFUNCTION

1. test each mag to confirm one is much worse
2. modify power setting and enrichen mixture to determine whether continued operation on BOTH is possible
3. If not, switch to good mag and land at nearest airport

### b. rough engine operation or overheat

See a. and c. In the event of normal oil pressure but high oil temperature, reduce power setting, lower nose to increase airspeed for cooling (without diving), and enrichen mixture for increased cooling.

### c. loss of oil pressure

1. *Oil temperature is rising*: engine failure may be imminent. Reduce power immediately and select forced landing field. Use minimum power to reach touchdown spot.
2. *Oil temperature is normal*: this could be a gauge malfunction. Land at nearest airport

### d. fuel starvation

### e. electrical fire

1. Master OFF
2. Avionics Switch OFF
3. All switches except ignition OFF
4. Vents/Cabin Air/Heat CLOSED (to avoid drafts)
5. Fire Extinguisher ACTIVATE. After discharge of extinguisher, vent the cabin

IF fire appears out

6. Master ON
7. Circuit Breakers CHECK for faulty, do not reset
8. Radio OFF
9. Avionics Switch ON
10. Radio and other switches ON ONE AT A TIME to check which circuit is the problem

### f. vacuum system failure

DG, Attiude Indicator are no longer accurate. For turns, use the Turn Coordinator and time rate 1 turns at 3°/sec.

### g. pitot or static blockage

[Video Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BMCyBD80Fk&t=85s)

1. Alternate Static Source Valve FULL ON
2. Pitot Heat ON
3. Airspeed — Consult appropriate calibration tables in Section 5 of POH

### h. cabin fire

1. Master OFF
2. Vents/Cabin Air/Heat CLOSED (to avoid drafts)
3. Fire Extinguisher ACTIVATE. After discharging an extinguisher within a closed cabin, ventilate the cabin.
4. Land ASAP

### i. carb icing

[Video Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4lwLffGEkA&t=113s)

1. Carb Heat ON FULL (POH 3-16)
2. Power FULL
3. Leave until engine operation is smooth
4. If conditions require continued use in cruise, use the minimum necessary to prevent ice and lean for smoothest operation

### j. electrical malfunctions

OVER-VOLTAGE LIGHT ILLUMINATES

1. Avionics Power OFF
2. Master OFF (both sides)
3. Master ON
4. Over-voltage Light CHECK OFF
5. Avionics Power ON
6. If over-voltage light illuminates again, terminate flight as soon as possible

AMMETER SHOWS DISCHARGE

1. Alternator OFF (Master)
2. Nonessential Radio/Electrical Equipment OFF
3. Terminate flight as soon as possible

### k. landing gear malfunctions

LANDING WITH A FLAT MAIN TIRE

1. Approach NORMAL
2. Touchdown GOOD TIRE FIRST, hold airplan off flat tire as long as possible.

### l. brake failure or seizure

### m. flap failure

If flaps are stuck up, fly normally to destination and perform a no-flap landing. If the destination airport is short or soft, divert to an aerodrome with a solid surface.

If the flaps are stuck down, land at an aerodrome as soon as possible to troubleshoot the situation.

### n. door opening in flight

(POH 7-15)
No need to land. Trim to 75 KIAS, momentarily shove door outward then forcefully close and lock the door

### o. spin recovery

PARE

1. Power IDLE
2. Ailerons NEUTRAL
3. Rudder (FULL OPPOSITE SPIN)
4. Elevator FORWARD to break the stall
5. Hold the inputs until the spin stops, then neutralize rudder and recover from dive.

### p. emergency descent

[Cabin Fire emergency descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc8RjuKCn_U&t=119s)

1. Power IDLE
2. 45 degree bank turn and let speed climb to V<sub>NO</sub> (128 KIAS on GNLR)

[WITH FLAPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc8RjuKCn_U&t=267s)

1. Power IDLE
2. 45 degree bank turn and let speed stay at V<sub>FE</sub> (85 KIAS on GNLR)
3. When at V<sub>FE</sub> full flaps

### q. any other emergency unique to the type of aeroplane flown

* LANDING WITHOUT ELEVATOR CONTROL

1. Trim for horizontal flight at 60 KIAS with 20° Flaps by using Throttle and elevator trim.
2. Note the RPM
3. Use power up and down to climb or descend
4 At flareout adjust trim full nose-up and close throttle at touchdown.
