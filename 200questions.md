    * Certificate of Airworthiness
    * Special Certificate of Airworthiness (issued when the aircraft doesn't have a type certificate or doesn't conform to an existing type certificate, for example Amateur-built)

3. **Under which circumstances to you need a flight permit?**

    All aircraft require flight authority to fly. There are three types of flight authority in Canada, the two different types of Certificates of Airworthiness and the flight permit. A flight permit is required to fly an aircraft if the aircraft doesn't conform to either a Certificate of Airworthiness or a Special Certificate of Airworthiness. Flight permits are valid up to 12 months. (CARs Standard 507.04(1))

4. **Name the different categories of standard airworthiness certificate.**

    For fixed-wing aircraft, the categories are normal, utility, aerobatic, commmuter, (*Airworthiness Manual* chapter 523) and transport (*Airworthiness Manual* chapter 525)

5. **What is the period of validity of the airworthiness certificate?**

    Indefinite validity, subject to requirement of CAR Standard 507 and 571 (maintenance)

6. **What permanently cancels the certificate?**

    Airworthiness Staff Instructions 46

7. **What cancels the certificate of airworthiness temporarily?**

8. **Can you name 5 situations beyond the manufacturer's standards?**

    1. Failure to comply with airworthiness directives
    2. Failure to comply with maintenance requirements
    3. An accident
    4. An action which violates the POH
    5. A snag (defect) in the journey log

9. **Can you explain if the given aircraft is airworthy and why? You must do this as PIC before every flight.**

### Certificate of Registration

    * the day on which a continuing certificate is issued

    (CARs 202.25(3))

## Radio Equipment

1. **If we replace the radio with a newer model, what should we do?**

    Ensure the radio is restricted to aircraft frequencies. If the radio will be used outside of Canada we must apply for and receive an aircraft radio station license from Industry Canada.

2. **What are the allowed frequencies to be used under this license?**

    * 108.0 - 117.975 MHz (NAV)
    * 117.975 - 137 MHz (COM)

3. **The use of aeronautical radio frequencies depends on which ministry or department?**

    Industry Canada

4. **Can we use a portable radio and under which circumstances?**

    Yes, without a license within Canada and in the air provided it meets Industry Canada requirements for radios. Outside Canada a license is required.

## Annual Airworthiness Information Report (A.A.I.R.)

1. **What is the AAIR?**

    An annual report owners must provide to Transport Canada containing essential airworthiness information such as the date of the last annual inspection, the number of hours flown in the previous calendar year, and the TTSN. (CARs 501.02)

2. **Name the mandatory periodic visits.**

    The annual inspection for all aircraft. If the aircraft is commercially registered, it must be inspected at 100-hour intervals even if it has been less than 1 year.

3. **What is the validity period for this report?**

    The report must be filed annually for the previous year before March 30.

4. **If the copy of the report has not been sent to Transport Canada can the aircraft be flown?**

5. **If the copy was sent, but the entries in the logbook were not made, can the aircraft be flown?**


## Instruments

65. **Which instruments are related to the vacuum system?**

    The Heading Indicator (Directional Gyro) and the Attitude Indicator use the vacuum system.

66. **How does the vacuum system work?**

    An engine-driven air pump draws air in from the outside of the aircraft through an air filter and then into the vacuum driven instruments. After the attitude indicator, the air passes through a suction gauge and then through the pump itself. The air exits overboard after the pump through the vent line. The moving air causes the gyroscopes in the DG and AI to rotate.

67. **What is the normal indication of the suction pump?**

    The green arc is 4.5 to 5.5 inches of Hg.

68. **What happens if the suction gauge exceeds normal values?**

    If pressure is outside of normal values the instruments may not behave as anticipated, there may be a blockage in the vacuum inlet or a dirty air filter, or the pumps may be failing.

69. **What happens if the suction reads within normal values?**

    If the suction indicates in the proper range air is drawn into the DG and AI to spin their gyros and they and they operate as intended.

70. **Which instruments are plugged into the static source?**

    The Airspeed Indicator, Vertical Speed Indicator, and Altimeter are connected to the static source.

71. **Which are the instruments connected to the pitot tube?**

    The Airspeed Indicator is the only instrument which uses the pitot system tube.

72. **If the static port is blocked, which instruments do not work?**

    The Airspeed Indicator, Vertical Speed Indicator, and Altimeter all give false readings if the static source is blocked.

73. **What does the instrument connected to the pitot tube indicate if the static port is blocked during climb or descent?**

    The Airspeed Indicator will indicate an increasing airspeed during climb and a decreasing airspeed during descent if the pitot system is sealed shut (blocked). This is because the pressure in the pitot system remains constant while the pressure in the static system changes. During ascent, the pressure in the static system decreases which increases the differential between it and the pitot system, indicating a higher airspeed. The opposite is true in descent.

74. **What can we do to restore the pitot-static circuit?**

    Eliminate the blockage. It may be ice, so turn on pitot heat to try to melt it! If there appears to be an issue with the static source, use the alternate static source which is enabled in the cockpit to the right of the throttle.

75. **If the pitot tube is blocked, what will the Airspeed, VSI and Altimeter indicate?**

    The VSI and Altimeter will perform as normal, but the Airspeed will tend to not move if in level flight. It will show a decrease in descent and increase in climb.

76. **Which instrument(s) have electric power supply?**

    The turn coordinator has an electric power supply. The GPS, ILS, VOR and radios also use electricity.

77. **Which instruments operate on the principles of gyroscopic precession and rigidity in space?**

    The turn coordinator, attitude indicator, and directional gyro depend on rigidity in space and gyroscopic precession to operate.

78. **Is the altimeter set from the pressure at field level or sea level?**

    The altimeter is set to sea level pressure. This value is derrived by a reporting station which is often above sea level and is correct down to sea level. As such, the necessary altimeter setting can be obtained by turning the knob while on the ground until the current field elevation is indicated.

79. **What is the tolerance for the altimeter?**

80. **During navigation between Montreal and Quebec, when will you change the altimeter setting?**

    Altimeter setting would be changed once received from CYQB ATIS prior to entering CYQB airspace.

81. **Why should we reset the directional gyroscope (DG)?**

    Precession causes the drift in the DG over time due to bearing friction. Periodic resetting during straight-and-level flight is achived by ensuring it matches the compass.

82. **If you turn on the transponder during flight, will it give information immediately?**

    Older transponders require time to warm up from when they're off. This can take several minutes and it's why the *Standby* setting exists. Newer transponders warm up quickly, but they must still receive an interrogation before responding with their code (Mode A) or altitude (Mode C).

83. **What is the operating principle of the transponder?**

    The transponder responds to interrogation pulses from ATC secondary RADAR. When these pulses are received, the transponder responds with its code, altitude info (if Mode C with ALT enabled) and if Mode S other data.
