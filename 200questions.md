    Fore-aft CG affects longitudinal stability of the airplane. With forward CG elevator authority to raise the nose is reduced. With aft CG elevator authority to lower the nose is reduced.

15. **Is the aircraft more maneuverable with a forward or aft centre of gravity?**

    Forward CG increases maneuverability due to lower angle of attack to maintain level flight.

16. **Is the aircraft more efficient with a forward or aft centre of gravity?**

    Aft CG increases efficiency because the horizontal stabilizer can produce less downforce.

17. **Does the stall speed change according to the location of the centre of gravity?**

    Yes. Stall speed decreases as CG moves aft because less downforce is required by the horizontal stabilizer.

    V<sub>ne</sub>
    * C-GNLR V<sub>ne</sub> 160 KIAS (POH 2-4)
    * C-FEWV V<sub>ne</sub> 174 MPH CAS (POH 4-3)

11. **What is the maneuvering speed?**

    The maneuvering speed, V<sub>a</sub>, is the speed at which the plane stalls before exceeding the load limit. At 2300 lbs, here is V<sub>a</sub> for each plane:

    * C-GNLR V<sub>a</sub> 97 KIAS
    * C-FEWV V<sub>a</sub> 122 MPH CAS

12. **What happens to the maneuvering speed when the weight changes?**

    Maneuvering speed increases with weight. This is because a higher AoA is required to maintain flight at higher weights. Since the load factor increases proportionately to the change in angle of attack, a smaller increase in load factor is required to push the plane past its critical AoA when the plane is highly loaded compared to when it is lightly loaded.

13. **What are the green, white, yellow and red arcs on the airspeed indicator?**

    * 65 MPH Full Flaps (C-FEWV POH 1-6)

18. **What is the true airspeed and consumption at 5000', +25°C and 70% BHP?**

    Assuming +25°C is at altitude (OAT, thus ISA+20)
    First interpolate between the closest %BHP figures at 4000' and 6000' in the 20°C ABOVE column in the C-GNLR POH (5-16) to yield the 70% figures at their respective altitudes.

    | P.Alt | Power | KTAS | GPH |
    |-------|-------|------|-----|
    | 4000' |  70%  | 117  | 7.8 |
    | 6000' |  70%  | 119  | 7.8 |

    Then interpolate between the 4000' and 6000' to get the 5000' figures.

    | P.Alt | Power | KTAS | GPH |
    |-------|-------|------|-----|
    | 5000' |  70%  | 118  | 7.8 |

19. **What is the best rate of climb at 5000'**

    Assuming ISA+20 as in question 18, first interpolate between the 4000' and 6000' rows in each of the 20°C and 40°C columns from C-GNLR POH (5-14) to yield the 5000' figures for their respective temperatures.

    | P.Alt | 20°C | 40°C |
    |-------|------|------|
    | 5000' | 493 fpm  |  435 fpm|

    Then use linear interpolation for 25°C

    (493 fpm - 435 fpm) / (20°C - 40°C) = -2.9 fpm/°C

    -2.9 fpm/°C * 5°C = -14.5 fpm

    493 fpm - 14.5 fpm ≈ **478 fpm**

20. **What is the endurance at the same altitude?**

    C-GNLR POH (5-19) 4.4 hours

21. **What is the range?**

22. **What will be the new estimated time of arrival at that speed?**

    This question is not answerable as the distance is not given. The solution would be calculated by dividing the distance by ground speed. The ground speed is calculated by adjusting the TAS from question 18 for wind.

23. **What is the total ground roll distance to clear a 50' obstacle, with a grass runway, 10 kts headwind at 5000'**

    C-GNLR (POH 5-12, Figure 5-4)

    * Headwind factor: (10 kts / 9 kts) * 10% = decrease distance by 11%
    * Grass factor: increase distance by 15% of ground roll
    * Temperature: Assume 25 degrees C from Question 18 and interpolate between 20 and 30.
    * Interpolated Ground Roll from table: 1385'
    * Interpolated 50' obstacle clearance from table: 2503'
    * Headwind factor minus 11% of obstacle clearance: -278'
    * Grass factor plus 15% of ground roll: +208'

    2503 - 278 + 208 = 2433'

    Three drains. One per wing and one under the engine (the fuel strainer)

35. **How do we ensure ventilation of the tanks?**

    Ensure the vent is clear on the left tank behind the strut.

36. **What is the tire pressure of the landing gear?**

    On C-GNLR (POH 8-12), 31 PSI on the nose wheel and 29 PSI on the main gear

## General Understanding and use of the Airplane

37. **What is the colour of 100LL?**

    Light Blue

38. **WHat is the octane level of 100LL?**

    100 octane

39. **If you can't obtain the proper fuel grade for your aircraft, what should you do?**

    Don't fly if the fuel doesn't comply with the POH.

40. **What causes detonation?**

    Detonation can be cause by excessive leaning, incorrect fuel (octane too low), or overheating of the engine.

41. **From what altitude can you adjust the mixture?**

    Mixture can be leaned from 3000' Density Altitude and above. 

42. **Why should we adjust the mixture?**

    The density of the air decreases as we climb. Leaning ensures the optimal ratio of fuel to air mixture through different altitudes. This allows us to save fuel, prevents spark plug fouling, and prevents other maintenance issues.

43. **What is the method to adjust the mixture**

    Any time you aren't starting the engine or taking off below 3000' DA. Specifically, Mike Busch, the leader of Savvy Aviation, has extensive engine experience and says that leaning for maximum RPM during ground ops and climb, and leaning as much as possible without roughness in cruise, is the ideal leaning regimen for fixed-pitch simple aircraft. To summarize:
    * Full-rich: only for start and takeoff below 3000' DA
    * Lean for max RPM: ground ops, takeoff and climb above 3000' DA (this involves pulling the mixture control and watching the tachometer. RPM climbs, set the mixture at max RPM)
    * Lean to onset of roughness: Cruise (this involves pulling the mixture out until the engine operates roughly then enriching until it is smooth again)

44. **What is the risk of too lean a mixture**

    Detonation (in which the fuel explodes instead of burning consistently and completely) is a risk at 75% power and above. This risk drops rapidly with lower power outputs.

45. **What is the advantage of a rich mixture during climb?**

    Cooling due to unburnt fuel moving through the engine. Also provides margin for detonation.

46. **What causes a white deposit at the exhaust outlet?**

    White deposits signify lead. This could be caused by running too lean.

47. **What causes a black dposit at the exhaust outlet?**

    Black deposits are unburnt hydrocarbons caused by running too rich.

48. **What causes white smoke at startup?**

    Smoke can be caused by oil burning or water in the engine.

49. **What happens if you prime too much before startup?**

    The engine can become flooded. This means the mixture is so rich that the fuel won't burn.

50. **When you put on carburator heat, what happens to the mixture?**

    The mixture becomes richer since the amount of air decreases with heat but the fuel remains the same.

51. **How can we detect carburator icing with a fixed or constant speed propeller?**

    With a fixed pitch propeller a reduction in RPM can be caused by carburator icing. With a constant speed propeller a reduction in manifold pressure can be caused by carburator icing. With a CS propeller a reduction in RPM may also be observed if the prop setting is at 100% speed.

52. **When can we remove carburator heat?**

    After application, carb heat should be left on until the engine starts rough-running and then runs smoothly again. Turning the carb heat off should increase RPM in a fixed-pitch aircraft and manifold pressure in a CS-prop aircraft.

53. **Why shouldn't we use carburator heat on the ground?**

    Carb heat bypasses the air filter so using it introduces debris into the engine.

54. **When selecting magnetos how much RPM can a magneto drop?**

    Up to 125 RPM

55. **What is the maximum allowed difference between the RPM drop on either single magneto during check?**

    50 RPM

56. **If no power drop occurs on the right magneto what does this mean?**

    Magnetos default to on. They are disabled through the use of a p-lead (a wire) connecting the primary coil of the magneto to ground. If setting ignition to right-only mag causes no RPM drop it could mean that the left mag isn't grounding (meaning it is permanently live) and thus that the p-lead is broken on the left mag. An alternative diagnosis is that the left mag is simply not working at all (permanently grounded) and thus the both setting and right setting show no difference. However, this can possibiliy can be eliminated by testing the left magneto which in this case should shut down the engine.

57. **What are the symptoms of fouled spark plugs?**

    Misfiring, rough engine running. This is especially likely in a cold engine that is running with a rich mixture.

58. **How can we clean fouled spark plugs?**

    Running the engine at a higher RPM and leaning can clean fouled spark plugs.

59. **What is the cabin heat system and how does it work?**

    The cabin heat system provides heat to the cabin when needed by diverting outside air around the exhaust manifold in a rudimentary heat exchanger where it picks up waste engine heat prior to entering the cabin.

60. **If the exhaust pipe was pierced, what is the related danger?**

    A pierced exhaust pipe would allow heated cabin air to directly mix with exhaust gases, creating a significant risk of CO poisoning in the cabin.

61. **Where can you find the type of oil used for the flight?**

    In the POH

    * C-GNLR POH 1-4
    * C-FEWV POH 5-8

62. **What are the four functions of the oil?**

    Cooling, lubricating, sealing, and cleaning (flushing)

63. **When do we use mineral oil?**

    During the first 50 hours of operation on a new engine, and not after.

64. **Where is the (fire resistant) identification plate of the aircraft?**

    The lower part of the left forward door post.

## Instruments

65. **Which instruments are related to the vacuum system?**

    The Heading Indicator (Directional Gyro) and the Attitude Indicator use the vacuum system.

66. **How does the vacuum system work?**

    An engine-driven air pump draws air in from the outside of the aircraft through an air filter and then into the vacuum driven instruments. After the attitude indicator, the air passes through a suction gauge and then through the pump itself. The air exits overboard after the pump through the vent line. The moving air causes the gyroscopes in the DG and AI to rotate.

67. **What is the normal indication of the suction pump?**

    The green arc is 4.6 to 5.4 inches of Hg (C-GNLR POH 7-34).

68. **What happens if the suction gauge exceeds normal values?**

    If pressure is outside of normal values the instruments may not behave as anticipated, there may be a blockage in the vacuum inlet or a dirty air filter, or the pumps may be failing.

69. **What happens if the suction reads within normal values?**

    If the suction indicates in the proper range air is drawn into the DG and AI to spin their gyros and they and they operate as intended.

70. **Which instruments are plugged into the static source?**

    The Airspeed Indicator, Vertical Speed Indicator, and Altimeter are connected to the static source.

71. **Which are the instruments connected to the pitot tube?**

    The Airspeed Indicator is the only instrument which uses the pitot system tube.

72. **If the static port is blocked, which instruments do not work?**

    The Airspeed Indicator, Vertical Speed Indicator, and Altimeter all give false readings if the static source is blocked.

73. **What does the instrument connected to the pitot tube indicate if the static port is blocked during climb or descent?**

    The Airspeed Indicator will indicate an increasing airspeed during climb and a decreasing airspeed during descent if the pitot system is sealed shut (blocked). This is because the pressure in the pitot system remains constant while the pressure in the static system changes. During ascent, the pressure in the static system decreases which increases the differential between it and the pitot system, indicating a higher airspeed. The opposite is true in descent.

74. **What can we do to restore the pitot-static circuit?**

    Eliminate the blockage. It may be ice, so turn on pitot heat to try to melt it! If there appears to be an issue with the static source, use the alternate static source which is enabled in the cockpit to the right of the throttle.

75. **If the pitot tube is blocked, what will the Airspeed, VSI and Altimeter indicate?**

    The VSI and Altimeter will perform as normal, but the Airspeed will tend to not move if in level flight. It will show a decrease in descent and increase in climb.

76. **Which instrument(s) have electric power supply?**

    The turn coordinator has an electric power supply. The GPS, ILS, VOR and radios also use electricity.

77. **Which instruments operate on the principles of gyroscopic precession and rigidity in space?**

    The turn coordinator, attitude indicator, and directional gyro depend on rigidity in space and gyroscopic precession to operate.

78. **Is the altimeter set from the pressure at field level or sea level?**

    The altimeter is set to sea level pressure. This value is derrived by a reporting station which is often above sea level and is correct down to sea level. As such, the necessary altimeter setting can be obtained by turning the knob while on the ground until the current field elevation is indicated.

79. **What is the tolerance for the altimeter?**

    ??

80. **During navigation between Montreal and Quebec, when will you change the altimeter setting?**

    Altimeter setting would be changed once received from CYQB ATIS prior to entering CYQB airspace.

81. **Why should we reset the directional gyroscope (DG)?**

    Precession causes the drift in the DG over time due to bearing friction. Periodic resetting during straight-and-level flight is achived by ensuring it matches the compass.

82. **If you turn on the transponder during flight, will it give information immediately?**

    Older transponders require time to warm up from when they're off. This can take several minutes and it's why the *Standby* setting exists. Newer transponders warm up quickly, but they must still receive an interrogation before responding with their code (Mode A) or altitude (Mode C).

83. **What is the operating principle of the transponder?**

    The transponder responds to interrogation pulses from ATC secondary RADAR. When these pulses are received, the transponder responds with its code, altitude info (if Mode C with ALT enabled) and if Mode S other data.

84. **Name the transponder codes that are important to know**

    * 7500 - hijacking
    * 7600 - COM failure
    * 7700 - emergency
    * 1200 - VFR default below 12,500' ASL
    * 1400 - VFR default above 12,500' ASL

85. **What are the precautions when displaying a discrete code?**

    Keep the code for the duration of the flight unless assigned a new code by ATC.

## Navigation

86. **How can we calculated the indicated airspeed from the true airspeed?**

    OAT and Pressure Altitude are required. Obtain CAS from POH table (C-GNLR 5-8, C-FEWV 6-2) then use OAT and P.Alt with an E6B or CX-3 to calculate TAS.

87. **How do you determine your cruising altitude?**

    Stay above MEF for entire flight, follow cruising altitudes order (Mag track in southern domestic airspace) above 3000' AGL, stay clear of clouds (VFR minima), optimize winds.

88. **What is the MEF?**

    The Maximum Elevation Figure is the greater of the highest terrain + 100m OR the height of the highest obstacle rounded up to the nearest 100' ASL.

89. **Is it mandatory to file a flight plan?**

    Flight plans are required beyond 25 NM of the departure aerodrome unless you file a flight itinerary with a responsible person. (CARs 602.73)

90. **When can we close a flight plan?**

    No more than 60 minutes after the scheduled arrival time.

91. **If we make 3 stops of 30 minutes each during a 3h30 flight what will you indicate in the "estimated flight time" box on the flight plan?**

    3.5 hrs + (0.5 hrs * 3) = 5 hrs.

92. **If it takes 6 minutes to fly 12 NM, how long does it take to fly 145 NM?**

    * 12 NM / 6 m = 2 NM/min
    * 145 NM / 2NM/min = 72.5 minutes

93. **If our fuel consumption is 7 USG/h, what is the amount needed for the flight in question 92?**

    * (72.5 minutes / 60 minutes/hr ) * 7 USG/hr = 8.5 USG
    * We will also need to account for taxi, takeoff, climb, descent, and reserve

94. **Having filed a flight plan, weather prevents us from maintaining our altitude and course. What should we do?**

    * Adjust course to stay clear of weather and identify position
    * FARDOT to plan a diversion
    * Call FSS/FIC to update flight plan

95. **If we had filed a flight itinerary, same question as 94**

    Same answer, but contact the responsible person as soon as possible.

96. **What are the minimum flight altitudes above an uncontrolled airfield?**

    2000' AAE unless for the purposes of landing or taking off. In these cases it is 500' above circuit altitude. (CARs 602.96(4))

97. **At which altitude can we turn after takeoff on the circuit side in order to leave the circuit?**

    Circuit altitude. (AIM RAC 4.5.2)

98. **At which altitude can we turn after takeoff on the inactive side in order to leave the circuit?**

    Circuit altitude + 1000' (AIM RAC 4.5.2) This accounts for aircraft descending to the circuit on the inactive side from 500' above the circuit.

99. **What are the VFR weather minima for controlled airspace?**

    * 3 SM horizontal visibility
    * 1 SM from cloud horizontally
    * 500' from cloud vertically

100. **What are the weather minima for uncontrolled airspace above 1000' AGL?**

    * 1 SM horizontal visibility day
    * 3 SM horizontal visibility night
    * 2000' from cloud horizontal
    * 500 ft from cloud vertical

101. **Can we fly across a class F airspace (CYA)?**

    Yes. This is advisory (CYA). We must be alert for the conditions specified in the *designated airspace handbook*.

102. **Under which circumstances should we carry a survival kit?**

    Operating beyond 25 NM of a departure aerodrome (CARs 602.61).

103. **When should we carry a life jacket?**

    When operating beyond gliding distance of shore OR beyond 50 NM of shore, whichever is less. (CARs 602.62)

104. **If you're unsure of your position, how should you proceed?**

    * Maintain straight and level flight and ensure DG is set correctly.
    * Check nav log for clues, for example drift applied incorrectly.
    * Consider returning to your last known position or point of reference.

105. **If you were unable to identify the last point of reference, what should you do?**

    * Look for something recognizable on the ground and try to find it on the map.
    * Draw a circle centered on the intended track line that matches your time enroute since last known position with a radius that is 10% of your estimated distance travelled since last known position and try to match your position. (Flight Training Manual p146)

106. **If you get lost, how do you proceed?**

    * Use panel GPS
    * Use your phone GPS
    * As a last resort, try to call ATC or a nearby FSS/FIC

107. **What is your range?**

    * Remaining fuel divided by fuel burn rate times speed
